# G'day!

Outside of my studies, I like watching anime, Korean drama, and superhero movies. I also like outdoor activities which I mostly explore during my time in Australia's bush capital, Canberra. Canberra has many wonderful walking and cycling tracks that everyone can enjoy. I walk, cycle, hike, and run. Visit my [gallery](./gallery.html) to view photos of some of the places that I have explored in Canberra!

Some highlights of my outdoor activities:
