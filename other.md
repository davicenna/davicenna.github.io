# G'day!

Outside of my studies, I like watching anime, Korean drama, and superhero movies. I mostly watch shonen anime including but not limited to Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, and Black Clover. Other than shonen animes, I also watch other genres like slice of life, drama, and romance.

I also like outdoor activities which I mostly explore during my time in Australia's bush capital, Canberra. Canberra has many wonderful walking and cycling tracks that everyone can enjoy. I cycle, hike, and run.
