# G'day!

Outside of my studies, I like watching anime, Korean drama, and superhero movies. I mostly watch shonen anime including but not limited to Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, and Black Clover. Other than shonen animes, I also watch other genres like slice of life, drama, and romance.

I also like outdoor activities which I mostly explore during my time in Australia's bush capital, Canberra. Canberra has many wonderful walking and cycling tracks that everyone can enjoy. I walk, cycle, hike, and run. Visit my [gallery](./gallery.html) to view photos of the places that I have explored in Canberra!

Furthermore, I learned Taekwondo since I was 12 years old but became less committed with martial arts training as I get older. I also play music, mainly the drums and acoustic guitar. I had a band during my senior highschool years where I was the drummer, and we performed on most school events. I haven't had the chance to perform again using a drumkit, but I still play the _cajon_ on some occasions.

Some highlights of my outdoor activities:
