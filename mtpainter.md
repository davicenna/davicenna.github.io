Mount Painter offers one of the best views of Canberra from its lookout. You can see both the Southern and Northern parts of Canberra, which not all lookouts in Canberra are able to offer. The hike to its lookout is not too steep and tiring, it is a quite easy hike with a really rewarding view!

Hiking in the afternoon is an advantage if you want to witness Canberra's beautiful sunset or if you want to see kangaroos lurking around.
