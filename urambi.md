Walking in the Urambi Hills Nature Reserve is perfect if you want to take a short walk or if you are new to trekking. On the way to the lookout, you will see lots of kangaroos lurking around the bushes if you came at the right time (in the early morning or in the afternoon before the sun sets). Once you get to the lookout, you will get a view of Tuggeranong as well as mountains and hills around South Canberra.

You can easily catch the R4 bus to get there!
